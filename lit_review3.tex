\section{Exiton Polariton Condensates}

A phenomenon of interest to physicists is that of condensation, where a macroscopic number of particles occupy the ground state of a system. 
Familiar examples include Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) of ultracold atoms \cite{1674-1056-24-5-050507} and BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) superconductivity \cite{PhysRev.108.1175}.
More recently, exciton-polaritons in microcavities have been observed to undergo condensation, although due to their non equilibrium nature there is greater subtlety involved \cite{Byrnes2014}.  

The basic experimental set up consists of a thin semiconducting material with reflective Bragg mirrors on either side, illustrated in \fig{\ref{fig:exciton-polariton}}.  
The material is illuminated with a laser, exciting an electron which forms a bound state with the remaining hole (an exciton). 
Across the $z$ plane of the semiconductor the band gap varies through alternating doping. 
This confines the excitons in the regions where the band gap is narrower, and the exciton is effectively only free to move in the $xy$ plane.
Although the mirrors are not perfectly reflective, with the lifetime of the polaritons being limited to $\sim$\SI{200}{\pico\second} in current experiments \cite{ 2014arXiv1408.1680S}, if the rate of recombination and electron excitation exceeds that of photon dissipation, the excitons are able to couple with the photons \cite{doi:10.1080/00107514.2010.550120}. 
This coupling can to good approximation lead to considering the oscillation between exciton and photon as a bosonic quasi particle known as a polariton.    

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{polaritonsystem.pdf}
	\caption{The exciton-polariton microcavity.
	Superconducting material of with an alternating band gap is sandwiched between Bragg mirrors. 
	A laser illuminates the semiconducting material which creates excitons that are confined in a 2D plane due to the doping. 
	With sufficient photon lifetime, the photons can couple with the exciton, effectively becoming a quasi particle known as a exciton-polariton \cite{Byrnes2014}.}
	\label{fig:exciton-polariton}
\end{figure}


The dispersion for the polariton is shown in \fig{\ref{fig:polaritondispersion}}. The lower polariton's (LP in the figure) is quadratic at small momenta but has a point of inflection the momentum is increased \cite{doi:10.1080/00107514.2010.550120}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{polaritondispersion.pdf}
	\caption{A dispersion graph for the exciton-polariton system. The angle corresponds to the momentum of the polariton. LP and UP are upper and lower polariton, respectively, and are the two eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian. Due to the photon's low effective mass compared to the exciton, the dispersion for the polariton is almost totally dependent on the photon dispersion. In experiments it is the LP modes that are become occupied. Its dispersion relation looks quadratic at low momentum but has a point inflection, tending to the exciton dispersion, at high momentum. \cite{doi:10.1080/00107514.2010.550120}}
	\label{fig:polaritondispersion}
\end{figure}

One can obtain a wide range of behaviour in the microcavity by varying the method of illumination. 
The momenta of the created polaritons in the microcavity plane depends on the $\sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle of the laser with respect to the plane \cite{doi:10.1080/00107514.2010.550120}. 
To obtain a condensate where a low momentum mode is macroscopically occupied, there a few standard methods, some of which we will describe, however in general they depend on the pump strength, and, after a level has been passed, accumulation of the low momentum states increases dramatically.

One such method is optical parametric amplification, where there the input is two light beams, a `pump' beam at a `magic angle' corresponding to the point of inflection of the lower polariton dispersion, and a `probe' beam at zero angle. 
The probe beam stimulates scattering of two pump polaritons to one with zero momentum and one with high momentum and energy, known as the signal and idler polaritons, respectively, in a way that conserves energy and momentum. 
The idler can then decay to the lower momentum state via phonon emission.
One may also achieve optical parametric oscillation (OPO), which does not require a probe beam, so that beyond a threshold pump power the density of the low and high momentum states increases.
This is illustrated in \fig{\ref{fig:opo}}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{opo.pdf}
	\caption{An illustration of optical parametric amplification/oscillation. A pump laser at a `magic angle' corresponding to the inflection point creates polaritons with this energy. 
	By stimulating at the zero momentum state with a probe laser, polariton-polariton scattering can occur to a high and low momentum polariton pair, known as the idler and signal, respectively. 
The idler can then emit phonons and decay to the inflection point.
	OPO is similar except it does not require a probe laser \cite{doi:10.1080/00107514.2010.550120}.}
	\label{fig:opo}
\end{figure}

In the case of incoherent pumping the high momentum polaritons decay by emitting phonons as described before, however due to the steep dispersion curve at the $k=0$ state, once the inflection point is crossed this process becomes inefficient and many phonons are needed. 
This creates a `bottle-neck' effect around the inflection point where a high density of polaritons is built up. 
At a sufficient polariton density, and by ensuring the polaritons are more exciton-like, polariton-polariton scattering can become dominant with the low and high momentum polaritons being created as before. 

These techniques allow experimenters to observe a BEC, for example in \cite{PhysRevLett.118.016602}, and illustrated in \fig{\ref{fig:polariton-condesation}}. 
In general, however, condensation is not necessarily indicative of the system being a BEC. 
Various regimes are possible where the system behaves more like a laser, a distinctly non-equilibrium system, or like a BEC as above.
It is thus most fruitful to consider the system as lying somewhere on a spectrum from the laser of BEC system \cite{Byrnes2014}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{polaritoncondensation.pdf}
	\caption{From \cite{PhysRevLett.118.016602}, the energy distribution of polaritons at two detunings $\delta$ (which is the energy difference between the cavity resonance and exciton energy at $k=0$) and various pump powers, shown here as increasing when going from blue to red. For zero detuning at a sufficient pump power, the distribution unambiguously points to Bose-Einstein statistics.}
	\label{fig:polariton-condesation}
\end{figure}

When condensation occurs, it is possible consider a macroscopic wavefunction $\psi(r)$ of the system. 
Writing the wavefunction as $\sqrt{\rho(r)} e^{i \theta (r)}$ where $\rho$ is the (real) amplitude, we note that the condensate allows the existence of vortices, a topological defect.
This means that we cannot continuously deform the state with vortices into the ground state, and thus this state cannot be obtained through perturbation theory methods.
Nethertheless they are physically meaningful.  

Since the value of the phase restrict to $[0, 2 \pi]$, i.e. it is compact, the circulation defined by 
\[
\oint \nabla \theta \cdot \dd{\myvec{l}} 
\]
must have values restricted to $2\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer. 
In the case of non-zero circulation, by continuously shrinking the loop we must maintain this circulation, implying that at a point the phase must take on all values from 0 to $2\pi$. 
Therefore the amplitude of the wavefunction must be zero at this point.
Vortices are crucial in Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics which has underpinned much of condensed matter in low dimensions \cite{jose201340}. 

To obtain some intuition on the subject, we can use relatively simple arguments \cite{altland2010condensed}: an isotropic solution for the phase angle that supports vortices is $|\nabla \theta(r)| =1/r$. 
The energy of the vortex in the continuum limit of the $XY$ model is
\[
\tfrac12 \int |\nabla \theta |^2 \dd r^2 \propto \log L
\]
where $L$ is the distance from the vortex, which we'll take as the system size. 
The number of places to place the vortex will also be proportional to $L^2$, so the entropy ($k \log \Omega$) will be proportional to $\log L$. 
The free energy $E - TS$ then shrinks or grows depending on the temperature, and there is a critical temperature where the formation of vortices is favourable. 
This is the BKT temperature.
The high temperature, disordered phase is characterised by the unbinding and proliferation of these vortices.
 
This phase transition is not quite the same as those encountered in three dimensions in that there is no continuous symmetry breaking: this is disallowed for short range interacting with a continuous symmetry due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem \cite{Coleman1973}. 
For the XY model, a global $SO(2)$ symmetry prevents an ordered phase, and the same is true of the polariton condensate. 
Instead, the form of the spatial correlation function (typically defined by $C(r,t) = \mean{\phi(\myvec{R} + \myvec{r}, t),\phi(\myvec{R}, t)}$ where the mean is a thermal average, so this measures correlations of $\phi$ at distances $r$ \cite{binney1992the}.) depends on which phase the system is in: in the high temperature phase there exists exponential decay of correlations $\propto \exp (-r / \xi)$. 
At low temperatures the system displays `quasi long range order' and the decay is algebraic (i.e. depends on $r$ to some power).
Here $r$ is the distance in both cases and $\xi$ is the correlation length. 
At criticality, the correlation length is infinite, and it tends to zero as one moves further away from the critical point in the disordered phase. 
 

\section{The KPZ Equation and the Polariton Regimes}

Considering the fluctuations of the wavefunction about the mean in writing $\psi = (\sqrt{\rho} + \chi)e^{i \theta}$ it is found \cite{2015PhRvX...5a1017A, PhysRevX.7.041006} that in the long wavelength limit the dynamics are solely governed by $\theta$ through the anisotropic Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation:
\[
\pdv{\theta}{t} = D_x \pdv[2]{\theta}{x} + D_y \pdv[2]{\theta}{y} + \frac{\lambda_x}{2}\left ( \pdv[2]{\theta}{x} \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda_y}{2} \left (\pdv[2]{\theta}{y} \right)^2 + \eta
\]
where $\eta$ is a noise term. 
The $D$s and $\lambda$s depend on the means at which the system is pumped. 
In both incoherently and coherently pumped systems, the equation is the same. 
However, in the OPO regime $\theta$ is actually given by $\theta_s - \theta_i$, the subscripts stand for `signal' and `idler', corresponding to the low and high momentum states.
The pump phase $\theta_p$ is fixed by the laser, and the relation $2 \theta_p = \theta_i + \theta_s$ removes another degree of freedom, leaving just one.  
In this case the wavefunction is a linear combination of each mode.

The different regimes of the condensate can be parametrised by the scaled nonlinearity 
\[
g \equiv \lambda_x^2/D_x^2\sqrt{D_x D_y}
\]
and the scaled anisotropy 
\[
\Gamma \equiv \lambda_y D_x / \lambda_x D_y.
\] 
For the KPZ equation to be stable, the $D$s must be positive.
The sign of the anisotropy therefore depends on the sign difference of the $\lambda$s. 
The cases $\Gamma > 0$ and $\Gamma < 0$ are called the weak and strong anisotropic phase, respectively, and only their relative sign matters.
BKT physics is reobtained when the non-linear terms vanish.

For the anisotropic KPZ equation renormalisation group (RG) analysis has been performed \cite{PhysRevLett.111.088701}.
The process essentially teases out long range behaviour by successive course graining and renormalising of the parameters, 
where the renormalisation occurs when shrinking the coarse grained length scale down to a smaller system length scale, such as nearest neighbour distance.
A `flow' of the parameter values is thus obtained (essentially a phase portrait), shown in \fig{\ref{fig:rgflows}}.
Two regions are found: for strongly anisotropic systems the there is a fixed point at $g=0$ and $\Gamma = -1$ for which one obtains equilibrium-like BKT regimes. 
For weak anisotropic systems the flow lines all tend to $g= \infty$ and asymptotically approach the $\Gamma =1$ limit. 
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{rgflow.png}
	\caption{RG flow lines for the parameters $\Gamma$ and $g$ defined in the main body. 
	For the strongly anisotropic case $\Gamma < 0$ all flows go to the fixed point $\Gamma =0$ and $g=-1$. 
	For the weak isotropic case $\Gamma >0$, flow lines tend to $\Gamma =1$ and $g = \infty$ \cite{PhysRevLett.111.088701}. }
	\label{fig:rgflows}

\end{figure}

In the case of incoherent pumping in the isotropic regime it is found \cite{2015PhRvX...5a1017A} that although in the thermodynamic limit the algebraic order will always be destroyed, the size $L^*$ to which a finite system can show algebraic correlation depends on a tuning parameter $x= \gamma_p / \gamma_l -1$ where the $\gamma$s are pump power and loss, respectively. 
Algebraic correlations may be destroyed in one of two ways: for a sufficiently large tuning parameter and system, decreasing the tuning parameter increases the nonequilibrium fluctuations so that the system enters the KPZ phase marked by stretched exponential correlations. 
Alternatively, a BKT transition may take place first. 
This is illustrated in \fig{\ref{fig:incoherentkpz}}.
It is noted that the KPZ length scale $L^*$ is much larger than realistic system sizes, and therefore may not be observed for incoherently pumped systems. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{incoherentkpz.pdf}
	\caption{The different regimes the system is in in the case of incoherent pumping depends on the tuning parameter $x$ and system size. At a combination with a sufficiently small system size and sufficiently large $x$, the system displays algebraic correlations. Depending on the system size, decreasing $x$ can lead to stretched exponential correlations either through entering the KPZ phase or via a BKT transition \cite{2015PhRvX...5a1017A}.}
	\label{fig:incoherentkpz}
\end{figure}

In systems with strong anisotropy there only exists a phase transition between the BKT phases.
A phase diagram that illustrates is shown in \fig{\ref{fig:incoherentanisotropic}}
In particular, the system exhibits `reentrance' which means that by increasing the pump power it is possible to enter into the algebraic regime, and then subsequently exit it on further increase.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{incoherentanisotropic.pdf}
	\caption{A phase diagram for the anistropic KPZ state for the incoherent pump for the parameters $\Gamma_0$ (as defined in the text) and the parameter $\kappa_0 = \Lambda/\sqrt{D_x D_y}$ where $\Lambda$ is the noise strength. 
	The curve shows a potential route that would be traversed in experiment as pump power is increased: the key feature of reentrance where the algebraic phase is entered and left as this path is crossed \cite{2015PhRvX...5a1017A}.}
	\label{fig:incoherentanisotropic}
\end{figure}

For coherent pumping another length scale $L_v$ has been considered above which vortex unbinding will occur. 
This has be calculated by mapping the compact KPZ equation to a non-linear electrodynamic theory \cite{PhysRevB.94.104520}.
A similar approach was taken in studying the BKT transition. 
For two vortices a distance $R$ away from each other, the force they experience $-\dv*{E}{R} \propto 1/R$. 
From this it follows that, in the $XY$ model, vortices can be mapped to coulombic charges. 
In the case of the KPZ equation due to the non-linear term there are also repulsive terms along with the coulombic attractions. 
Thus in the case $\lambda \neq 0$, the phase of the system is not driven by the entropic considerations as in the $XY$ model but in actuality above a length scale $L_v$ vortex unbinding will always occur. 

The analogous analysis of the above in the case of coherent pumping (the OPO regime specifically) included this length.
Coherent pumping displays similar phases as the incoherent pump, specifically in reentrance, however in experimental realisations the various regimes can be explored much more easily with the available system size by varying the detuning (see the caption below \fig{\ref{fig:polariton-condesation}}, pump power, and pump wavevector. 
For the weak anistropic regime, the length scales as a function of the pump strength relative to the maximum pump strength that allows the OPO regime is shown in \fig{\ref{fig:coherentwa}}.
Although the length scale $L_v$ is less than that of $L_{\textrm{KPZ}}$ where the KPZ phase would be observable, thus seemingly precluding the KPZ phase, it has been pointed out that in numerical studies of up to \SI{1000}{\mu \meter} that the vortex rich phase appears absent \cite{PhysRevX.5.041028}, which could suggest a prevention of the vortex proliferation, or an underestimation of $L_v$.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{coherentwa.pdf}
	\caption{The case of coherent pumping in the weak anisotropic regime. This shows the various length scales as a function of the pump power normalised to the maximum pump that allows the OPO regime. For most values of pump power the $L_v$ is less than that of $L_{\textrm{KPZ}}$ where the KPZ phase would be observable.}
	\label{fig:coherentwa}
\end{figure}

\section{$XY$ model scaling violations}

In \cite{PhysRevLett.84.1503} the dynamical scaling of the $XY$ model was studied. 
In particular, the system, starting from two different initial conditions (zero and infinite temperature), was quenched to the BKT critical temperature and the value of the Binder cumulant defined by 
\[
	g_L(t) = 2 - \frac{\mean{\myvec{M}^2}^2}{\mean{\myvec{M}^4}}
\]
where $\myvec{M}$ is the total magnetisation, was calculated at various sizes $L$. 
Monte Carlo dynamics was employed (using the Metropolis algorithm) and the mean was over independent Monte Carlo runs.

As mentioned, the correlation length becomes infinite at the critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. 
However for a finite system this cannot occur. 
With the assumption that $\xi$ depends on the time since quench $t$ in some way, the Binder cumulant could be written as a function $f$ depending on $\xi$, but to account for the finite size of the system it actually depends on the ratio $\xi/L$.
This is the finite size scaling. 
Therefore when plotting $g$ as a function of this ratio, a collapse of the plots for different system sizes should occur, provided the dynamical scaling of $\xi(t)$ is correct. 

It is expected that the dynamical scaling would be $\xi \propto t^{1/z}$, where $z=2$ is an equilibrium exponent in fluctuations, when quenching from the ordered state.
This was found to be the case, however the scaling required modification when quenching from the disordered phase and was $\xi \propto (t/\ln t)^{1/2}$, shown in \fig{\ref{fig:xyscaling}}.  
The interpretation was that the length scale $\xi$ could be substituted approximately by the vortex distance. 
The friction experienced by the vortices slowed their annihilation and thus modified the dynamical scaling to be as given.  

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{xyscaling.pdf}
	\caption{Scaling violation of the Binder cumulant $g$ when quenching from the disordered phase to the critical temperature. 
	Rather than standard scaling form $\xi \propto t^{1/z}$ ($z$ being 2 when quenching from the ordered phase), it is modified by $\xi \propto (t/\ln(t))^{1/2}$ due to vortex interactions \cite{PhysRevLett.84.1503}.}
	\label{fig:xyscaling}
\end{figure}
	

\section{Project Proposal}

The project aim is to study the dynamical scaling when quenching from various regimes in OPO polariton condensates.  
Because there are repulsive contributions to the vortex interactions, this will presumably force the scaling to have extra or modified terms. 
The terms that are there will also depend on which phase the system is initially prior to quenching and to which critical point it is quenched to. 
In particular, scaling should reduce to that of the $XY$ model in the BKT phase.

Due to the system being a non-equilibrium one, Monte Carlo dynamics are innapropriate.
Instead, stochastic dynamics will be used. 
This requires discretising the KPZ equation and insisting on compactness, as has been done in \cite{PhysRevB.94.104521}. The result is, for the isotropic KPZ equation, the prescription \cite{PhysRevB.94.104521}: 
\[
	\nabla^2 \theta \to - \sum_{\myvec{a}} \sin ( \theta_{\myvec{x}} - \theta_{\myvec{x} + \myvec{a}})
\]
and
\[
	(\nabla \theta )^2 \to - \sum_{\myvec{a}} ( \cos ( \theta_{\myvec{x}} - \theta_{\myvec{x} + \myvec{a}}) - 1 )
\]
where the $\myvec{a}$ are the nearest neighbour distances.

\subsection{Project Timeline}

Although the precise timing and order of tasks is not known at this point, roughly the project breakdown is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Familiarisation with the techniques required in simulating stochastic differential equations and performing the finite size scaling.
\item Programming the simulation.
\item Verifying that the correct scaling holds for the known regimes.
\item Performing the simulation on the new regimes, meanwhile thoroughly studying the electromagnetic duality mapping.
\item Finding the correct scaling for the new regimes and determine the physical basis for the terms.
